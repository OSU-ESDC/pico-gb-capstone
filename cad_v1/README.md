# This folder contains the files for the Gaming System Shell, version 1 (the one presented at the S2025 Expo with no PCB). 

### There are two folders for the CAD files - one for STEP files, and one for STL files. 
- Use the STL files to print the controller shell.
- Use the STEP files to open the controller shell design and make edits to it.
